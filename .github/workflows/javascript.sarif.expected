This means that `this` in the function body will refer to the global object, so the assignments to `x` and `y` will create global variables.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nThe easiest way to fix this is to rewrite the call on line 7 to use `new`:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = new Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nAlternatively, if you absolutely have to make it possible to call `Point` both with and without `new`, you could insert a guard that intercepts calls without `new` as follows:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction Point(x, y) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Point))\n    return new Point(x, y);\n  this.x = x;\n  this.y = y;\n}\n\nvar p = new Point(23, 42),\n    q = Point(56, 72);\n\n```\nNow, if `Point` is invoked without `new`, its `this` object (which is the global object) is not an instance of `Point`, so the \"then\" branch of the `if` statement is executed, which re-invokes `Point` on the same arguments, but this time with `new`.\n\n\n## References\n* D.

Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engines provided by many popular JavaScript platforms use backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general. The worst-case time complexity of such an automaton can be polynomial or even exponential, meaning that for strings of a certain shape, increasing the input length by ten characters may make the automaton about 1000 times slower.\n\nTypically, a regular expression is affected by this problem if it contains a repetition of the form `r*` or `r+` where the sub-expression `r` is ambiguous in the sense that it can match some string in multiple ways. More information about the precise circumstances can be found in the references.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nModify the regular expression to remove the ambiguity, or ensure that the strings matched with the regular expression are short enough that the time-complexity does not matter.\n\n\n## Example\nConsider this use of a regular expression, which removes all leading and trailing whitespace in a string:\n\n```javascript\n\ntext.replace(/^\\s+|\\s+$/g, ''); // BAD\n```\nThe sub-expression `\"\\s+$\"` will match the whitespace characters in `text` from left to right, but it can start matching anywhere within a whitespace sequence. This is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a whitespace character. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each whitespace sequence once per whitespace character in the sequence.\n\nThis ultimately means that the time cost of trimming a string is quadratic in the length of the string. So a string like `\"a b\"` will take milliseconds to process, but a similar string with a million spaces instead of just one will take several minutes.\n\nAvoid this problem by rewriting the regular expression to not contain the ambiguity about when to start matching whitespace sequences. For instance, by using a negative look-behind (`/^\\s+|(?<!\\s)\\s+$/g`), or just by using the built-in trim method (`text.trim()`).\n\nNote that the sub-expression `\"^\\s+\"` is **not** problematic as the `^` anchor restricts when that sub-expression can start matching, and as the regular expression engine matches from left to right.\n\n\n## Example\nAs a similar, but slightly subtler problem, consider the regular expression that matches lines with numbers, possibly written using scientific notation:\n\n```javascript\n\n/^0\\.\\d+E?\\d+$/.test(str) // BAD\n```\nThe problem with this regular expression is in the sub-expression `\\d+E?\\d+` because the second `\\d+` can start matching digits anywhere after the first match of the first `\\d+` if there is no `E` in the input string.\n\nThis is problematic for strings that do **not** end with a digit. Such a string will force the regular expression engine to process each digit sequence once per digit in the sequence, again leading to a quadratic time complexity.\n\nTo make the processing faster, the regular expression should be rewritten such that the two `\\d+` sub-expressions do not have overlapping matches: `^0\\.\\d+(E\\d+)?$`.\n\n\n## Example\nSometimes it is unclear how a regular expression can be rewritten to avoid the problem. In such cases, it often suffices to limit the length of the input string. For instance, the following regular expression is used to match numbers, and on some non-number inputs it can have quadratic time complexity:\n\n```javascript\n\n/^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$/.test(str) // BAD\n```\nIt is not immediately obvious how to rewrite this regular expression to avoid the problem. However, you can mitigate performance issues by limiting the length to 1000 characters, which will always finish in a reasonable amount of time.\n\n```javascript\n\nif (str.length > 1000) {\n    throw new Error(\"Input too long\");\n}\n\n/^(\\+|-)?(\\d+|(\\d*\\.\\d*))?(E|e)?([-+])?(\\d+)?$/.test(str)\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Regular expression Denial of Service - ReDoS](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Regular_expression_Denial_of_Service_-_ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [ReDoS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReDoS).\n* Wikipedia: [Time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity).\n* James Kirrage, Asiri Rathnayake, Hayo Thielecke: [Static Analysis for Regular Expression Denial-of-Service Attack](http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~hxt/research/reg-exp-sec.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-1333](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1333.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-730](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/730.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

            "markdown" : "# Inefficient regular expression\nSome regular expressions take a long time to match certain input strings to the point where the time it takes to match a string of length *n* is proportional to *n<sup>k</sup>* or even *2<sup>n</sup>*. Such regular expressions can negatively affect performance, or even allow a malicious user to perform a Denial of Service (\"DoS\") attack by crafting an expensive input string for the regular expression to match.\n\nThe regular expression engines provided by many popular JavaScript platforms use backtracking non-deterministic finite automata to implement regular expression matching. While this approach is space-efficient and allows supporting advanced features like capture groups, it is not time-efficient in general.

This type of attack uses external entity references to access arbitrary files on a system, carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or server-side request forgery. Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, DoS attacks are still possible and out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow attackers to steal sensitive data.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe easiest way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable external entity handling when parsing untrusted data. How this is done depends on the library being used. Note that some libraries, such as recent versions of `libxml`, disable entity expansion by default, so unless you have explicitly enabled entity expansion, no further action needs to be taken.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses the `libxml` XML parser to parse a string `xmlSrc`.

            "markdown" : "# XML external entity expansion\nParsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may lead to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack. This type of attack uses external entity references to access arbitrary files on a system, carry out denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, or server-side request forgery. Even when the result of parsing is not returned to the user, DoS attacks are still possible and out-of-band data retrieval techniques may allow attackers to steal sensitive data.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe easiest way to prevent XXE attacks is to disable external entity handling when parsing untrusted data. How this is done depends on the library being used. Note that some libraries, such as recent versions of `libxml`, disable entity expansion by default, so unless you have explicitly enabled entity expansion, no further action needs to be taken.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses the `libxml` XML parser to parse a string `xmlSrc`. If that string is from an untrusted source, this code may be vulnerable to an XXE attack, since the parser is invoked with the `noent` option set to `true`:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n  libxml = require(\"libxmljs\");\n\napp.post(\"upload\", (req, res) => {\n  let xmlSrc = req.body,\n    doc = libxml.parseXml(xmlSrc, { noent: true });\n});\n\n```\nTo guard against XXE attacks, the `noent` option should be omitted or set to `false`.

            "text" : "# XML internal entity expansion\nParsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may be vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks exploiting uncontrolled internal entity expansion.\n\nIn XML, so-called *internal entities* are a mechanism for introducing an abbreviation for a piece of text or part of a document. When a parser that has been configured to expand entities encounters a reference to an internal entity, it replaces the entity by the data it represents. The replacement text may itself contain other entity references, which are expanded recursively. This means that entity expansion can increase document size dramatically.\n\nIf untrusted XML is parsed with entity expansion enabled, a malicious attacker could submit a document that contains very deeply nested entity definitions, causing the parser to take a very long time or use large amounts of memory. This is sometimes called an *XML bomb* attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe safest way to prevent XML bomb attacks is to disable entity expansion when parsing untrusted data. How this is done depends on the library being used.

            "markdown" : "# XML internal entity expansion\nParsing untrusted XML files with a weakly configured XML parser may be vulnerable to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks exploiting uncontrolled internal entity expansion.\n\nIn XML, so-called *internal entities* are a mechanism for introducing an abbreviation for a piece of text or part of a document. When a parser that has been configured to expand entities encounters a reference to an internal entity, it replaces the entity by the data it represents. The replacement text may itself contain other entity references, which are expanded recursively. This means that entity expansion can increase document size dramatically.\n\nIf untrusted XML is parsed with entity expansion enabled, a malicious attacker could submit a document that contains very deeply nested entity definitions, causing the parser to take a very long time or use large amounts of memory. This is sometimes called an *XML bomb* attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe safest way to prevent XML bomb attacks is to disable entity expansion when parsing untrusted data. How this is done depends on the library being used. Note that some libraries, such as recent versions of `libxmljs` (though not its SAX parser API), disable entity expansion by default, so unless you have explicitly enabled entity expansion, no further action is needed.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses the XML parser provided by the `node-expat` package to parse a string `xmlSrc`.

That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    log(\"Exception occurred\", err.stack);\n    res.end(\"An exception occurred\"); // OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n",

Furthermore, the error message at the top of a stack trace can include information such as server-side file names and SQL code that the application relies on, allowing an attacker to fine-tune a subsequent injection attack.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nSend the user a more generic error message that reveals less information. Either suppress the stack trace entirely, or log it only on the server.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an exception is caught and its stack trace is sent back to the remote user as part of the HTTP response. As such, the user is able to see a detailed stack trace, which may contain sensitive information.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    res.end(err.stack); // NOT OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\nInstead, the stack trace should be logged only on the server. That way, the developers can still access and use the error log, but remote users will not see the information:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require('http');\n\nhttp.createServer(function onRequest(req, res) {\n  var body;\n  try {\n    body = handleRequest(req);\n  }\n  catch (err) {\n    res.statusCode = 500;\n    res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"text/plain\");\n    log(\"Exception occurred\", err.stack);\n    res.end(\"An exception occurred\"); // OK\n    return;\n  }\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\");\n  res.setHeader(\"Content-Length\", body.length);\n  res.end(body);\n}).listen(3000);\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Improper Error Handling](https://owasp.org/www-community/Improper_Error_Handling).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-497](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html).\n"

            "text" : "# Resource exhaustion\nApplications are constrained by how many resources they can make use of. Failing to respect these constraints may cause the application to be unresponsive or crash. It is therefore problematic if attackers can control the sizes or lifetimes of allocated objects.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that attackers can not control object sizes and their lifetimes. If object sizes and lifetimes must be controlled by external parties, ensure you restrict the object sizes and lifetimes so that they are within acceptable ranges.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example allocates a buffer with a user-controlled size.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar size = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.size);\n\n\tlet buffer = Buffer.alloc(size); // BAD\n\n\t// ... use the buffer\n});\n```\nThis is problematic since an attacker can choose a size that makes the application run out of memory. Even worse, in older versions of Node.js, this could leak confidential memory. To prevent such attacks, limit the buffer size:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar size = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.size);\n\n\tif (size > 1024) {\n\t\tres.statusCode = 400;\n\t\tres.end(\"Bad request.\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tlet buffer = Buffer.alloc(size); // GOOD\n\n\t// ... use the buffer\n});\n```\n\n## Example\nAs another example, consider an application that allocates an array with a user-controlled size, and then fills it with values:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar size = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.size);\n\n\tlet dogs = new Array(size).fill(\"dog\"); // BAD\n\n\t// ... use the dog\n});\n```\nThe allocation of the array itself is not problematic since arrays are allocated sparsely, but the subsequent filling of the array will take a long time, causing the application to be unresponsive, or even run out of memory.

            "markdown" : "# Resource exhaustion\nApplications are constrained by how many resources they can make use of. Failing to respect these constraints may cause the application to be unresponsive or crash. It is therefore problematic if attackers can control the sizes or lifetimes of allocated objects.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that attackers can not control object sizes and their lifetimes. If object sizes and lifetimes must be controlled by external parties, ensure you restrict the object sizes and lifetimes so that they are within acceptable ranges.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example allocates a buffer with a user-controlled size.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar size = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.size);\n\n\tlet buffer = Buffer.alloc(size); // BAD\n\n\t// ... use the buffer\n});\n```\nThis is problematic since an attacker can choose a size that makes the application run out of memory. Even worse, in older versions of Node.js, this could leak confidential memory. To prevent such attacks, limit the buffer size:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar size = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.size);\n\n\tif (size > 1024) {\n\t\tres.statusCode = 400;\n\t\tres.end(\"Bad request.\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tlet buffer = Buffer.alloc(size); // GOOD\n\n\t// ... use the buffer\n});\n```\n\n## Example\nAs another example, consider an application that allocates an array with a user-controlled size, and then fills it with values:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar size = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.size);\n\n\tlet dogs = new Array(size).fill(\"dog\"); // BAD\n\n\t// ... use the dog\n});\n```\nThe allocation of the array itself is not problematic since arrays are allocated sparsely, but the subsequent filling of the array will take a long time, causing the application to be unresponsive, or even run out of memory. Again, a limit on the size will prevent the attack:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar size = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.size);\n\n\tif (size > 1024) {\n\t\tres.statusCode = 400;\n\t\tres.end(\"Bad request.\");\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n\tlet dogs = new Array(size).fill(\"dog\"); // GOOD\n\n\t// ... use the dogs\n});\n```\n\n## Example\nFinally, the following example lets a user choose a delay after which a function is executed:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar http = require(\"http\"),\n    url = require(\"url\");\n\nvar server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {\n\tvar delay = parseInt(url.parse(req.url, true).query.delay);\n\n\tsetTimeout(f, delay); // BAD\n\n});\n\n```\nThis is problematic because a large delay essentially makes the application wait indefinitely before executing the function.

This may allow a malicious actor to make changes to a JWT payload.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst jwt = require(\"jsonwebtoken\");\n\nconst secret = \"my-secret-key\";\n\nvar token = jwt.sign({ foo: 'bar' }, secret, { algorithm: \"none\" })\njwt.verify(token, false, { algorithms: [\"HS256\", \"none\"] })\n```\nThe following code fixes the problem by using a cryptographic secret or key to decode JWT payloads.\n\n\n```javascript\n\nconst jwt = require(\"jsonwebtoken\");\n\nconst secret = \"my-secret-key\";\n\nvar token = jwt.sign({ foo: 'bar' }, secret, { algorithm: \"HS256\" }) \njwt.verify(token, secret, { algorithms: [\"HS256\", \"none\"] })\n```\n\n## References\n* Auth0 Blog: [Meet the \"None\" Algorithm](https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/#Meet-the--None--Algorithm).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-347](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/347.html).\n"

Alternatively, check that the untrusted data is a literal value and not a query object before using it in a query.\n\nFor SQL queries, use query parameters or prepared statements to embed untrusted data into the query string, or use a library like `sqlstring` to escape untrusted data.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, assume the function `handler` is an HTTP request handler in a web application, whose parameter `req` contains the request object.\n\nThe handler constructs an SQL query string from user input and executes it as a database query using the `pg` library. The user input may contain quote characters, so this code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // BAD: the category might have SQL special characters in it\n  var query1 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\" +\n    req.params.category +\n    \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can use query parameters to embed the user input into the query string. In this example, we use the API offered by the `pg` Postgres database connector library, but other libraries offer similar features. This version is immune to injection attacks.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: use parameters\n  var query2 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=$1 ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query2, [req.params.category], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can use a library like `sqlstring` to escape the user input before embedding it into the query string:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      SqlString = require('sqlstring'),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the category is escaped using mysql.escape\n  var query1 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\" +\n    SqlString.escape(req.params.category) +\n    \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an express handler attempts to delete a single document from a MongoDB collection. The document to be deleted is identified by its `_id` field, which is constructed from user input. The user input may contain a query object, so this code is vulnerable to a NoSQL injection attack.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst mongoose = require(\"mongoose\");\nconst Todo = mongoose.model(\n  \"Todo\",\n  new mongoose.Schema({ text: { type: String } }, { timestamps: true })\n);\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\n\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // BAD: id might be an object with special properties\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can use the `$eq` operator to ensure that the user input is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: { $eq: id } }); // GOOD: using $eq operator for the comparison\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n```\nAlternatively check that the user input is a literal value and not a query object before using it:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  if (typeof id !== \"string\") {\n    res.status(400).json({ status: \"error\" });\n    return;\n  }\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // GOOD: id is guaranteed to be a string\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).\n* MongoDB: [$eq operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/eq).\n* OWASP: [NoSQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-90](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-943](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/943.html).\n",

This version is immune to injection attacks.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: use parameters\n  var query2 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY=$1 ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query2, [req.params.category], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\nAlternatively, we can use a library like `sqlstring` to escape the user input before embedding it into the query string:\n\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"express\")(),\n      pg = require(\"pg\"),\n      SqlString = require('sqlstring'),\n      pool = new pg.Pool(config);\n\napp.get(\"search\", function handler(req, res) {\n  // GOOD: the category is escaped using mysql.escape\n  var query1 =\n    \"SELECT ITEM,PRICE FROM PRODUCT WHERE ITEM_CATEGORY='\" +\n    SqlString.escape(req.params.category) +\n    \"' ORDER BY PRICE\";\n  pool.query(query1, [], function(err, results) {\n    // process results\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an express handler attempts to delete a single document from a MongoDB collection. The document to be deleted is identified by its `_id` field, which is constructed from user input. The user input may contain a query object, so this code is vulnerable to a NoSQL injection attack.\n\n\n```javascript\nconst express = require(\"express\");\nconst mongoose = require(\"mongoose\");\nconst Todo = mongoose.model(\n  \"Todo\",\n  new mongoose.Schema({ text: { type: String } }, { timestamps: true })\n);\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));\n\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // BAD: id might be an object with special properties\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\nTo fix this vulnerability, we can use the `$eq` operator to ensure that the user input is interpreted as a literal value and not as a query object:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: { $eq: id } }); // GOOD: using $eq operator for the comparison\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n```\nAlternatively check that the user input is a literal value and not a query object before using it:\n\n\n```javascript\napp.delete(\"/api/delete\", async (req, res) => {\n  let id = req.body.id;\n  if (typeof id !== \"string\") {\n    res.status(400).json({ status: \"error\" });\n    return;\n  }\n  await Todo.deleteOne({ _id: id }); // GOOD: id is guaranteed to be a string\n\n  res.json({ status: \"ok\" });\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Wikipedia: [SQL injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection).\n* MongoDB: [$eq operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/eq).\n* OWASP: [NoSQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-pdf-archive/GOD16-NOSQL.pdf).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-89](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-90](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/90.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-943](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/943.html).\n"

            "text" : "# Type confusion through parameter tampering\nSanitizing untrusted HTTP request parameters is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or path traversal. This is sometimes done by checking if the request parameters contain blacklisted substrings.\n\nHowever, sanitizing request parameters assuming they have type `String` and using the builtin string methods such as `String.prototype.indexOf` is susceptible to type confusion attacks. In a type confusion attack, an attacker tampers with an HTTP request parameter such that it has a value of type `Array` instead of the expected type `String`. Furthermore, the content of the array has been crafted to bypass sanitizers by exploiting that some identically named methods of strings and arrays behave differently.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCheck the runtime type of sanitizer inputs if the input type is user-controlled.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, Node.js server frameworks usually present request parameters as strings.

            "markdown" : "# Type confusion through parameter tampering\nSanitizing untrusted HTTP request parameters is a common technique for preventing injection attacks such as SQL injection or path traversal. This is sometimes done by checking if the request parameters contain blacklisted substrings.\n\nHowever, sanitizing request parameters assuming they have type `String` and using the builtin string methods such as `String.prototype.indexOf` is susceptible to type confusion attacks. In a type confusion attack, an attacker tampers with an HTTP request parameter such that it has a value of type `Array` instead of the expected type `String`. Furthermore, the content of the array has been crafted to bypass sanitizers by exploiting that some identically named methods of strings and arrays behave differently.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nCheck the runtime type of sanitizer inputs if the input type is user-controlled.\n\nAn even safer alternative is to design the application so that sanitization is not needed, for instance by using prepared statements for SQL queries.\n\n\n## Example\nFor example, Node.js server frameworks usually present request parameters as strings. But if an attacker sends multiple request parameters with the same name, then the request parameter is represented as an array instead.\n\nIn the following example, a sanitizer checks that a path does not contain the `\"..\"` string, which would allow an attacker to access content outside a user-accessible directory.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar app = require(\"express\")(),\n  path = require(\"path\");\n\napp.get(\"/user-files\", function(req, res) {\n  var file = req.param(\"file\");\n  if (file.indexOf(\"..\") !== -1) {\n    // BAD\n    // we forbid relative paths that contain ..\n    // as these could leave the public directory\n    res.status(400).send(\"Bad request\");\n  } else {\n    var absolute = path.resolve(\"/public/\" + file);\n    console.log(\"Sending file: %s\", absolute);\n    res.sendFile(absolute);\n  }\n});\n\n```\nAs written, this sanitizer is ineffective: an array like `[\"../\", \"/../secret.txt\"]` will bypass the sanitizer.

Sensitive information within URLs may be logged in various locations, including the user's browser, the web server, and any forward or reverse proxy servers between the two endpoints. URLs may also be displayed on-screen, bookmarked or emailed around by users. They may be disclosed to third parties via the Referer header when any off-site links are followed. Placing sensitive information into the URL therefore increases the risk that it will be captured by an attacker.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse HTTP POST to send sensitive information as part of the request body; for example, as form data.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows two route handlers that both receive a username and a password.

            "text" : "# Unvalidated dynamic method call\nJavaScript makes it easy to look up object properties dynamically at runtime. In particular, methods can be looked up by name and then called. However, if the method name is user-controlled, an attacker could choose a name that makes the application invoke an unexpected method, which may cause a runtime exception. If this exception is not handled, it could be used to mount a denial-of-service attack.\n\nFor example, there might not be a method of the given name, or the result of the lookup might not be a function. In either case the method call will throw a `TypeError` at runtime.\n\nAnother, more subtle example is where the result of the lookup is a standard library method from `Object.prototype`, which most objects have on their prototype chain. Examples of such methods include `valueOf`, `hasOwnProperty` and `__defineSetter__`. If the method call passes the wrong number or kind of arguments to these methods, they will throw an exception.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is best to avoid dynamic method lookup involving user-controlled names altogether, for instance by using a `Map` instead of a plain object.\n\nIf the dynamic method lookup cannot be avoided, consider whitelisting permitted method names. At the very least, check that the method is an own property and not inherited from the prototype object. If the object on which the method is looked up contains properties that are not methods, you should additionally check that the result of the lookup is a function. Even if the object only contains methods, it is still a good idea to perform this check in case other properties are added to the object later on.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an HTTP request parameter `action` property is used to dynamically look up a function in the `actions` map, which is then invoked with the `payload` parameter as its argument.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = {\n  play(data) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  pause(data) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  let action = actions[req.params.action];\n  // BAD: `action` may not be a function\n  res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n});\n\n```\nThe intention is to allow clients to invoke the `play` or `pause` method, but there is no check that `action` is actually the name of a method stored in `actions`. If, for example, `action` is `rewind`, `action` will be `undefined` and the call will result in a runtime error.\n\nThe easiest way to prevent this is to turn `actions` into a `Map` and using `Map.prototype.has` to check whether the method name is valid before looking it up.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = new Map();\nactions.set(\"play\", function play(data) {\n  // ...\n});\nactions.set(\"pause\", function pause(data) {\n  // ...\n});\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  if (actions.has(req.params.action)) {\n    if (typeof actions.get(req.params.action) === 'function'){\n      let action = actions.get(req.params.action);\n    }\n    // GOOD: `action` is either the `play` or the `pause` function from above\n    res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n  } else {\n    res.end(\"Unsupported action.\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nIf `actions` cannot be turned into a `Map`, a `hasOwnProperty` check should be added to validate the method name:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = {\n  play(data) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  pause(data) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  if (actions.hasOwnProperty(req.params.action)) {\n    let action = actions[req.params.action];\n    if (typeof action === 'function') {\n      // GOOD: `action` is an own method of `actions`\n      res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n      return;\n    }\n  }\n  res.end(\"Unsupported action.\");\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Denial of Service](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service).\n* MDN: [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).\n* MDN: [Object.prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-754](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html).\n",

If the method call passes the wrong number or kind of arguments to these methods, they will throw an exception.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nIt is best to avoid dynamic method lookup involving user-controlled names altogether, for instance by using a `Map` instead of a plain object.\n\nIf the dynamic method lookup cannot be avoided, consider whitelisting permitted method names. At the very least, check that the method is an own property and not inherited from the prototype object. If the object on which the method is looked up contains properties that are not methods, you should additionally check that the result of the lookup is a function. Even if the object only contains methods, it is still a good idea to perform this check in case other properties are added to the object later on.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, an HTTP request parameter `action` property is used to dynamically look up a function in the `actions` map, which is then invoked with the `payload` parameter as its argument.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = {\n  play(data) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  pause(data) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  let action = actions[req.params.action];\n  // BAD: `action` may not be a function\n  res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n});\n\n```\nThe intention is to allow clients to invoke the `play` or `pause` method, but there is no check that `action` is actually the name of a method stored in `actions`. If, for example, `action` is `rewind`, `action` will be `undefined` and the call will result in a runtime error.\n\nThe easiest way to prevent this is to turn `actions` into a `Map` and using `Map.prototype.has` to check whether the method name is valid before looking it up.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = new Map();\nactions.set(\"play\", function play(data) {\n  // ...\n});\nactions.set(\"pause\", function pause(data) {\n  // ...\n});\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  if (actions.has(req.params.action)) {\n    if (typeof actions.get(req.params.action) === 'function'){\n      let action = actions.get(req.params.action);\n    }\n    // GOOD: `action` is either the `play` or the `pause` function from above\n    res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n  } else {\n    res.end(\"Unsupported action.\");\n  }\n});\n\n```\nIf `actions` cannot be turned into a `Map`, a `hasOwnProperty` check should be added to validate the method name:\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\nvar actions = {\n  play(data) {\n    // ...\n  },\n  pause(data) {\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\napp.get('/perform/:action/:payload', function(req, res) {\n  if (actions.hasOwnProperty(req.params.action)) {\n    let action = actions[req.params.action];\n    if (typeof action === 'function') {\n      // GOOD: `action` is an own method of `actions`\n      res.end(action(req.params.payload));\n      return;\n    }\n  }\n  res.end(\"Unsupported action.\");\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [Denial of Service](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Denial_of_Service).\n* MDN: [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).\n* MDN: [Object.prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-754](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/754.html).\n"

One particular example of this is HTML entity encoding, where HTML special characters are replaced by HTML character entities to prevent them from being interpreted as HTML markup.

For example, the string `me & \"you\"` is encoded as `me &amp; &quot;you&quot;`, and the string `&quot;` is encoded as `&amp;quot;`.\n\nThe decoding function, however, incorrectly decodes `&amp;` into `&` before handling the other characters. So while it correctly decodes the first example above, it decodes the second example (`&amp;quot;`) to `\"` (a single double quote), which is not correct.\n\nInstead, the decoding function should decode the ampersand last:\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports.encode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&/g, \"&amp;\")\n          .replace(/\"/g, \"&quot;\")\n          .replace(/'/g, \"&apos;\");\n};\n\nmodule.exports.decode = function(s) {\n  return s.replace(/&quot;/g, \"\\\"\")\n          .replace(/&apos;/g, \"'\")\n          .replace(/&amp;/g, \"&\");\n};\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP Top 10: [A1 Injection](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_A1-Injection).\n* npm: [html-entities](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-entities) package.\n* npm: [js-string-escape](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-string-escape) package.\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html).\n",

However, if the regular expression is not written well it might be possible to circumvent it, which can lead to cross-site scripting or other security issues.\n\nSome of these mistakes are caused by browsers having very forgiving HTML parsers, and will often render invalid HTML containing syntax errors. Regular expressions that attempt to match HTML should also recognize tags containing such syntax errors.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a well-tested sanitization or parser library if at all possible.

            "markdown" : "# Bad HTML filtering regexp\nIt is possible to match some single HTML tags using regular expressions (parsing general HTML using regular expressions is impossible). However, if the regular expression is not written well it might be possible to circumvent it, which can lead to cross-site scripting or other security issues.\n\nSome of these mistakes are caused by browsers having very forgiving HTML parsers, and will often render invalid HTML containing syntax errors. Regular expressions that attempt to match HTML should also recognize tags containing such syntax errors.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nUse a well-tested sanitization or parser library if at all possible.

Using the leaked token, the attacker can then construct the real reset link and use it to change the victim's password.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nObtain the server's host name from a configuration file and avoid relying on the Host header.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example uses the `req.host` to generate a password reset link. This value is derived from the Host header, and can thus be set to anything by an attacker:\n\n\n```javascript\nlet nodemailer = require('nodemailer');\nlet express = require('express');\nlet backend = require('./backend');\n\nlet app = express();\n\nlet config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8'));\n\napp.post('/resetpass', (req, res) => {\n  let email = req.query.email;\n  let transport = nodemailer.createTransport(config.smtp);\n  let token = backend.getUserSecretResetToken(email);\n  transport.sendMail({\n    from: 'webmaster@example.com',\n    to: email,\n    subject: 'Forgot password',\n    text: `Click to reset password: https://${req.host}/resettoken/${token}`,\n  });\n});\n\n```\nTo ensure the link refers to the correct web site, get the host name from a configuration file:\n\n\n```javascript\nlet nodemailer = require('nodemailer');\nlet express = require('express');\nlet backend = require('./backend');\n\nlet app = express();\n\nlet config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8'));\n\napp.post('/resetpass', (req, res) => {\n  let email = req.query.email;\n  let transport = nodemailer.createTransport(config.smtp);\n  let token = backend.getUserSecretResetToken(email);\n  transport.sendMail({\n    from: 'webmaster@example.com',\n    to: email,\n    subject: 'Forgot password',\n    text: `Click to reset password: https://${config.hostname}/resettoken/${token}`,\n  });\n});\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Mitre: [CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html).\n* Ian Muscat: [What is a Host Header Attack?](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/automated-detection-of-host-header-attacks/).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-640](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html).\n",

For instance, the expression `p in obj` checks whether the object `obj` contains a property whose name equals the string that `p` evaluates to. If `p` does not evaluate to a string or `o` does not evaluate to an object, implicit conversions are performed before the check is carried out.\n\nIn many cases, however, these implicit conversions result from a typo or a misunderstanding of operator precedence rules. Even if the conversions are intentional, relying on them makes the code hard to understand.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nInspect the expression carefully to check whether the operands have been mistyped, and correct them if this is the case. If the conversions are intentional, consider replacing them by explicit conversions to clarify the meaning of the code.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following code intends to check whether object `obj` does not contain a property of the name stored in variable `member`:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction invk(obj, member) {\n    if (!member in obj)\n        throw new Error(\"No such member: \" + member);\n    return obj[member]();\n}\n```\nHowever, this test is ineffective as written: the operator `!` binds more tightly than `in`, so it is applied first. Applying `!` to a non-empty string yields `false`, so the `in` operator actually ends up checking whether `obj` contains a property called `\"false\"`.\n\nTo fix this, parentheses should be introduced as follows:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction invk(obj, member) {\n    if (!(member in obj))\n        throw new Error(\"No such member: \" + member);\n    return obj[member]();\n}\n```\nAs an example of the intentional use of implicit conversions, consider the following function for comparing two numbers `x` and `y`. It returns `1` if `x>y`, `-1` if `x<y`, and `0` if they are equal.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction cmp(x, y) {\n    return (x > y) - (x < y);\n}\n```\nIt would be much clearer to write this out directly:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction cmp(x, y) {\n    if (x > y)\n        return 1;\n    if (x < y)\n        return -1;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\nAt the very least, the Boolean comparison results should be explicitly converted to numbers:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction cmp(x, y) {\n    return +(x > y) - +(x < y);\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Ecma International, *ECMAScript Language Definition*, 5.1 Edition, Section 9.

If it is no longer needed, remove it.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example shows a `cleanupLater` function that asynchronously will perform a cleanup task after some delay. When the cleanup task completes, the function invokes the provided callback parameter `cb`. To prevent a crash by invoking `cb` when it has the value `undefined`, defensive code guards the invocation by checking if `cb` is truthy.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction cleanupLater(delay, cb) {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        cleanup();\n        if (cb) { // BAD: useless check, `cb` is always truthy\n            cb();\n        }\n    }, delay)\n}\n\ncleanupLater(1000, function(){console.log(\"Cleanup done\")});\n\n```\nHowever, the `cleanupLater` function is always invoked with a callback argument, so the defensive code condition always holds, and it is therefore not required. The function can therefore be simplified to:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction cleanupLater(delay, cb) {\n    setTimeout(function() {\n        cleanupNow();\n        // GOOD: no need to guard the invocation\n        cb();\n    }, delay)\n}\n\ncleanupLater(function(){console.log(\"Cleanup done\")});\n\n```\nGuarding against the same situation multiple times is another example of defensive code that provides no practical use. The example below shows a function that assigns a value to a property of an object, where defensive code ensures that the assigned value is not `undefined` or `null`.\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setSafeStringProp(o, prop, v) {\n    // BAD: `v == null` is useless\n    var safe = v == undefined || v == null? '': v;\n    o[prop] = safe;\n}\n\n```\nHowever, due to coercion rules, `v == undefined` holds for both the situation where `v` is`undefined` and the situation where `v` is`null`, so the `v == null` guard serves no purpose, and can be removed:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction setSafeStringProp(o, prop, v) {\n    // GOOD: `v == undefined` handles both `undefined` and `null`\n    var safe = v == undefined?

Since that variable is always `undefined` in the \"else\" branch, attempting to invoke it will result in an exception at runtime.\n\nTo fix this problem, `error` could be turned into a `let`-bound variable to avoid the accidental name capture:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction error(msg) {\n  console.log(msg);\n}\n\nfunction processResponse(response) {\n  if (response.status === 200) {\n    let error = processResponseText(response.responseText);\n    if (error)\n       throw error;\n  } else {\n    error(\"Unexpected response status \" + response.status);\n  }\n}\n```\nAlternatively, if ECMAScript 5 compatibility is desired, the `error` variable could be renamed instead, as in this example:\n\n\n```javascript\nfunction error(msg) {\n  console.log(msg);\n}\n\nfunction processResponse(response) {\n  if (response.status === 200) {\n    var err = processResponseText(response.responseText);\n    if (err)\n       throw err;\n  } else {\n    error(\"Unexpected response status \" + response.status);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## References\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Calling functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#Calling_functions).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html).\n",

As it stands, this code performs a greater-or-equal comparison between the constant string `\"hello\"` and the number zero, which evaluates to `false`. This value is then passed to `indexOf`, which converts it to the string `\"false\"` and returns the first index at which this string occurs in `text` (or `-1` if it does not occur at all).\n\nTo fix this issue, the test should be rebracketed like this:\n\n\n```javascript\nif (text.indexOf(\"hello\") >= 0)\n\tconsole.log(\"Found it.\");\n```\n\n## References\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Comparison Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators).\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [Equality comparisons and when to use them](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_when_to_use_them).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-570](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/570.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-571](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/571.html).\n",

This means that the `this` expressions of such callbacks evaluate to `undefined` or the global object. Using an ES6 class method as a callback therefore means that the `this` expressions of the method do not refer to the class instance.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nEnsure that the receiver object of event handler methods that use `this` expressions is not `undefined`.

Use the keyword `constructor` to declare constructors in a class, use the keyword `new` to declare constructors inside interfaces, and don't use `function` when declaring a call signature in an interface.\n\n\n## Example\nThe below example declares an interface `Point` with 2 fields and a method called `constructor`.

If the regular expression is not anchored, it only needs to match a substring of the input and won't necessarily match the whole string.\n\nIf the regular expression being searched for accepts the empty string, this means it can match an empty substring anywhere in the input string, and will thus always find a match. In this case, testing if a match exists is redundant and indicates dead code.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nExamine the regular expression and determine how it was intended to match:\n\n* To match the whole input string, add anchors at the beginning and end of the regular expression.\n* To search for an occurrence within the input string, consider what the shortest meaningful match is and restrict the regular expression accordingly, such as by changing a `*` to a `+`.\n\n## Example\nIn the following example, a regular expression is used to check the format of a string `id`. However, the check always passes because the regular expression can match the empty substring. For example, it will allow the ID string \"`%%`\" by matching an empty string at index 0.\n\n\n```javascript\nif (!/[a-z0-9]*/.test(id)) {\n    throw new Error(\"Invalid id: \" + id);\n}\n\n```\nTo ensure the regular expression matches the whole string, add anchors at the beginning and end:\n\n\n```javascript\nif (!/^[a-z0-9]*$/.test(id)) {\n    throw new Error(\"Invalid id: \" + id);\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* Mozilla Developer Network: [JavaScript Regular Expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).\n"

For example, if the property access is used as part of a write, an attacker may overwrite vital properties of objects, such as `__proto__`. This attack is known as *prototype pollution attack* and may serve as a vehicle for denial-of-service attacks. A similar attack vector, is to replace the `toString` property of an object with a primitive. Whenever `toString` is then called on that object, either explicitly or implicitly as part of a type coercion, an exception will be raised.\n\nMoreover, if the name of an HTTP header is user-controlled, an attacker may exploit this to overwrite security-critical headers such as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` or `Content-Security-Policy`.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nThe most common case in which prototype pollution vulnerabilities arise is when JavaScript objects are used for implementing map data structures. This case should be avoided whenever possible by using the ECMAScript 2015 `Map` instead. When this is not possible, an alternative fix is to prepend untrusted input with a marker character such as `$`, before using it in properties accesses. In this way, the attacker does not have access to built-in properties which do not start with the chosen character.\n\nWhen using user input as part of a header name, a sanitization step should be performed on the input to ensure that the name does not clash with existing header names such as `Content-Security-Policy`.\n\n\n## Example\nIn the example below, the dynamically computed property `prop` is accessed on `myObj` using a user-controlled value.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\nvar myObj = {}\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n\tvar prop = req.query.userControlled; // BAD\n\tmyObj[prop] = function() {};\n\tconsole.log(\"Request object \" + myObj);\n});\n```\nThis is not secure since an attacker may exploit this code to overwrite the property `__proto__` with an empty function. If this happens, the concatenation in the `console.log` argument will fail with a confusing message such as \"Function.prototype.toString is not generic\". If the application does not properly handle this error, this scenario may result in a serious denial-of-service attack. The fix is to prepend the user-controlled string with a marker character such as `$` which will prevent arbitrary property names from being overwritten.\n\n\n```javascript\nvar express = require('express');\n\nvar app = express();\nvar myObj = {}\n\napp.get('/user/:id', function(req, res) {\n\tvar prop = \"$\" + req.query.userControlled; // GOOD\n\tmyObj[prop] = function() {};\n\tconsole.log(\"Request object \" + myObj);\n});\n```\n\n## References\n* Prototype pollution attacks: [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/9287), [lodash](https://hackerone.com/reports/310443), [hoek](https://npmjs.com/advisories/566).\n* Penetration testing report: [ header name injection attack](http://seclists.org/pen-test/2009/Mar/67)\n* npm blog post: [ dangers of square bracket notation](https://github.com/nodesecurity/eslint-plugin-security/blob/3c7522ca1be800353513282867a1034c795d9eb4/docs/the-dangers-of-square-bracket-notation.md)\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-250](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/250.html).\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html).\n",

If a value should be used, then opt for the `enum` type which only allows a predefined set of strings.\n- Use escaping functions in `sap.base.security`. Relevant sanitizers include `encodeXML` and `encodeHTML`.\n- When using API  with `apiVersion: 2` (Semantic Rendering), do not use `RenderManager.unsafeHtml` unless the control property `sanitizeContent` is set to `true`.\n- When using the now-deprecated older API with `RenderManager.write` or `RenderManager.writeAttribute`, use their respective counterparts `RenderManager.writeEscaped` and `RenderManager.writeAttributeEscaped` which sanitizes their rendered contents.\n\n### Preventing XSS Not Involving User Defined Control\n\nAn XSS attack vector can still exist even when no user-defined control is used. In this case, a model property or a control property act as an intermediate step when external data is passed in.\nIn this case, the UI5 application should not use the property as is, but should sanitize the contents before reading it. Such sanitization can take place in the controller or in the view declaration using expression bindings.\n\n## Example\n\n### Custom Control with Custom Rendering Method\n\nThis custom control `vulnerable.control.xss` calls `unsafeHtml` on a given `RenderManager` instance in its static renderer function. Since its `text` property is an unrestricted string type, it can point to a string with contents that can be interpreted as HTML. If it is the case, `unsafeHtml` will render the string, running a possibly embedded JavaScript code in it.\n\n```javascript\nsap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/core/Control\"], function (Control) {\n    return Control.extend(\"vulnerable.control.xss\", {\n        metadata: { properties: { text: { type: \"string\" } } },\n        renderer: {\n            apiVersion: 2,\n            render: function (oRm, oControl) {\n                oRm.openStart(\"div\", oControl);\n                oRm.unsafeHtml(oControl.getText()); // sink\n                oRm.close(\"div\");\n            }\n        }\n    });\n})\n```\n\nThis is the same custom control without the possibility of XSS using several means of sanitization: The property `text` is enforced to a non-string type, hence disallows unrestricted strings (This is espcially applicable if the expected input is a number anyways). Also, the `sap.base.security.encodeXML` function is used to escape HTML control characters.\n\n```javascript\nsap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/core/Control\", \"sap/base/security/encodeXML\"], function (Control, encodeXML) {\n    return Control.extend(\"vulnerable.control.xss\", {\n        metadata: { properties: { text: { type: \"int\" } } }, // constrain the type\n        renderer: {\n            apiVersion: 2,\n            render: function (oRm, oControl) {\n                oRm.openStart(\"div\", oControl);\n                oRm.unsafeHtml(encodeXML(oControl.getText()); // encode using security functions\n                oRm.close(\"div\");\n            }\n        }\n    });\n})\n```\n\n### Library Control\n\nThis example contains only library controls that are not user-defined. The untrusted user input flows from `sap.m.Input` and directly flows out via `sap.ui.core.HTML` through the model property `input` as declared in the `onInit` method of the controller.\n\n``` xml\n<sap.ui.core.mvc.View controllerName=\"vulnerable.controller.app\">\n  <sap.m.Input value=\"{/input}\" />\t <!-- XSS Source -->\n  <sap.ui.core.HTML content=\"{/input}\"/> <!-- XSS Sink -->\n</sap.ui.core.mvc.View>\n```\n\n``` javascript\nsap.ui.define([\"sap/ui/core/mvc/Controller\", \"sap/ui/model/json/JSONModel\"],\n  function (Controller, JSONModel) {\n    return Controller.extend(\"vulnerable.controller.app\", {\n      onInit: function () {\n        var oData = { input: null };\n        var oModel = new JSONModel(oData);\n        this.getView().setModel(oModel);\n      },\n    });\n  },\n);\n```\n\nThe issue can be resolved by setting the `HTML` control's `sanitizeContent` attribute to true.\n\n``` xml\n<sap.ui.core.mvc.View controllerName=\"vulnerable.controller.app\">\n  <sap.m.Input value=\"{/input}\" />\n  <sap.ui.core.HTML content=\"{/input}\" sanitizeContent=\"true\" />\n</sap.ui.core.mvc.View>\n```\n\n## References\n\n- OWASP: [DOM Based XSS](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS).\n- SAP: [Cross-site Scripting](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/91f0bd316f4d1014b6dd926db0e91070.html) in UI5.\n- SAP: [Prevention of Cross-site Scripting](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/4de64e2e191f4a7297d4fd2d1e233a2d.html) in UI5.\n- SAP: [API Documentation of sap.ui.core.RenderManager](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui.core.RenderManager)\n- SAP: [Documentation of sap.ui.core.HTML](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/api/sap.ui.core.HTML%23methods/setSanitizeContent)\n- SAP: [Defining Control Properties](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/ac56d92162ed47ff858fdf1ce26c18c4.html).\n- SAP: [Expression Binding](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/daf6852a04b44d118963968a1239d2c0).\n- Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-79](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html).\n- Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-116](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/116.html).\n",
