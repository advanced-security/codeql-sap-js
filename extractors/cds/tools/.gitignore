# Ignore the entire "out" directory as this is for the .js and .js.map files
# which are generated by the `tsc` build process. In the current project config,
# we require the platform-specific "index-files" shell/cmd script to run the
# `npm run build` command that generates the files for the correct platform and
# local environment.

# is being run, we do not need/want to check-in our own package-lock.json version
# when we know it will be different / overwritten on each system.
