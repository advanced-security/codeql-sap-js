# CSRF protection disabled in HANA XS application

This XS application is not protected against CSRF (cross-site request forgery) because it either disables the protection or fails to enable the protection explicitly.

## Overview

A web server that receives a request from a client without verifying that it was intentionally sent might be vulnerable to Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). An attacker can trick a client into making an unintended request to the web server that will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, `XMLHttpRequest`, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

## Recommendation

SAPâ€™s recommendation is to use CSRF protection for any request that could be processed by a browser client by normal users.
- If `XS Advanced` is used, CSRF protection is configured with the `"csrfProtection"` property of `xs-app.json`. It is **enabled by default and should not be disabled.**
- If `XS Classic` is used, CSRF protection is configured with the `"prevent_xsrf"` property of `.xsaccess`. It is **disabled by default and should be enabled explicitly.**

## Example

The following `xs-app.json` fragment disables CSRF protection of the application it configures.

```json
"routes": [
    {
        "source": "/bad/(.*)",
        "destination": "srv_api",
        "csrfProtection": false,
        ...
    },
    ...
]
```
