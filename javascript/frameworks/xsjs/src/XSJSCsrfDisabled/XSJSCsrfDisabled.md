# Disabled XSJS CSRF protection

When you set up a web server to receive a request from a client without any mechanism for verifying that it was intentionally sent, then it is vulnerable to attack. An attacker can trick a client into making an unintended request to the web server that will be treated as an authentic request. This can be done via a URL, image load, XMLHttpRequest, etc. and can result in exposure of data or unintended code execution.

## Recommendation

When you use XSJS, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is enabled by default. SAPâ€™s recommendation is to use CSRF protection for any request that could be processed by a browser client by normal users.

## Example

The following `xs-app.json` fragment enables CSRF protection in XSJS.

``` javascript
"routes": [
  {
    "source": "/bad/(.*)",
    "destination": "srv_api",
    "csrfProtection": true,
```
